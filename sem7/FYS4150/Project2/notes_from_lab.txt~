use compiler crioterions
-O3 vectorizes

for vecotrization we must know the number of iterations for the loop before it starts
avoid exit statements depending on specific values made in the loop, this makes it impossible to vectorize

avoided statements like switch, go to.
avoid function calls(some functions like sin,cos are already vectorized so they will work)
inline functions will also work


smart things is to use the no optimization flag first (-O0) to see if the vectorized version works correctly)

-O3 is the recmended way

# Project2
This repository contains all files related to Project 2 of Computational Physics (FYS4150) at UiO Fall of 2015.
The aim of the project is to use the Jacobi rotation method to solve Schr√∂dinger's equation for two elcectrons in a three dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, with, and without a repulsive Coloumb interaction.

Benchmark results can be found in the Benchmark folder. The folder contain selected results that the program should reproduce with a set of given values.

The most important files are as follows:

Project2.pdf - The report for the project.

Project2.tex - The latex file that made the report.

main.cpp - The main program

Project2.pro - The qt project file

output.txt - Outputfile for main.cpp. This file gets rewritten each time main.cpp is compiled and run.

plotting.py - Python program that plots the results from the main program found in output.txt

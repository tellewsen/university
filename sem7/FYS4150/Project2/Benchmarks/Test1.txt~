Test1:
Running the program with n = 2, and rho_max=50 with V[i] = rho[i]*rho[i]; as the potential should produce the 
following output:
---------------------------------
Jacobi time = 7e-06 sec
Number of iterations: 1
625.003
2500
6.9522e-310
6.9522e-310
0
Armadillo time = 7.4e-05 sec
625.003
2500
6.95312e-310
6.95312e-310
0
Output written to file output.txt
---------------------------------
Note that the program finishes in 1 iteration, confirming that the jacobi method is implemented correctly.

Test1:
Running the program with n = 2, and rho_max=50 with V[i] = rho[i]*rho[i]; as the potential should produce the 
following output:
---------------------------------
Jacobi time = 7e-06 sec
Number of iterations: 1
625.003
2500
6.9522e-310
6.9522e-310
0
Armadillo time = 7.4e-05 sec
625.003
2500
6.95312e-310
6.95312e-310
0
Output written to file output.txt
---------------------------------
Note that the program finishes in 1 iteration, confirming that the jacobi method is implemented correctly.

Test2 : 
Running the program with n=1000 ,rho_max=50 , and the potential for two electrons gives the following output when checking for orthogonality:
---------------------------------
Armadillo time = 1.82003 sec
17.4485
37.0708
56.8515
76.7008
96.5874
All the eigenvectors are orthogonal!

---------------------------------
Note the magical line telling us that the eigenvectors are orthogonal, confirming that the method works.

# QUESTION a)
 
# Read the data and variable names into a data frame, and take a look at the data
aserum=read.table("http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK4900/v11/serum.dat", header=T)
aserum
 
# QUESTION a)
 
# Plot serum response against time for the different persons (identified by colors) and treatments
# (identified by solid or dotted line) using the matplot command for multiple lines in a plot.
hours.mat= matrix(c(1,2,3,6), nrow=4,ncol=10)
druga=matrix(aserum$serum[aserum$drug==1], nrow=4)
drugb=matrix(aserum$serum[aserum$drug==2], nrow=4)
serum.mat=cbind(druga, drugb)
matplot(hours.mat, serum.mat, type="l", lty=c(1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2), col=c(1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5),xlab="Hours",ylab="Serum",lwd=2)
 
# Think about what the plot tells you!
#-Most people reach the top at 2 hours. Some guy has no effect.
 
# QUESTION c)
# We first compute the AUC for each person and each drug:
auc=matrix(0,nrow=5,ncol=2)
for (i in 1:5)
for (j in 1:2)
{
s=aserum$serum[aserum$subject==i&aserum$drug==j]
auc[i,j]=s[1]+s[2]+2*s[3]+1.5*s[4]
}
# Perform the computations and make sure that you get the AUCs
 
# Perform a paired t-test
t.test(auc[,1],auc[,2], paired=T)
 
# What you may conclude from this hypothesis testing?
#-Not a good model
 
# QUESTION d)
# In order to fit a random effects model we will use the nlme-package.
# If this has not been installed, you will have to do so. At the end of the introduction to R, it is described how you may install new R-packages.
# In order to fit the modell, you then give the commands:
library(nlme)        # load the nlme-package
fit.random=lme(serum~factor(drug)+factor(time),random=~1|subject,data=aserum,method="ML")
summary(fit.random)
 
 
# QUESTION e)
# In order to test if drug has an effect, you may fit a modell without drug and use the anova-command to compare the modell with the one from question d.
library(nlme)        # load the nlme-package
fit.random=lme(serum~+factor(time),random=~1|subject,data=aserum,method="ML")
summary(fit.random)
anova(fit.random)

# AST5220

This is a project where we model the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB).

For any students taking the course, looking for some pointers on how to do this project, you should know there is a mistake in here somewhere. I have not bothered looking very thoroughly for it so it may be a simple one, or you might spend ages looking for it.

That being said, I've chosen to let this project remain online so that it can be used as a pointer if someone were to get stuck on some part. 

This is only the master version of the course, so neutrinos are not included, though I expect including them should prove to be more annoying than difficult.

;0: flat_image has "currents" going around, there's a vertical
;line in the middle(the line between the two CCDs). dark_image has one light
;part to the left and a darker(still pretty light) on the right.

;1: dark_image has faint, dark horizontal lines going through. flat_image
;now has one vertial line in the middle of each side.

;2: flat_image has diagonal lines going from top right to bottom
;left. The previously mentioned lines are still present. dark_image
;has the horizontal lines already mentioned as well, but they are less
;faint now.

;3: flat_image now has diagonal lines going from top left to bottom
;right. All previous lines still present. dark_image still has
;horizontal lines. Not sure if they are more visible or not.

;4: Same as before, but more visible for both images. Noticing a
;pattern emerging in flat_image. 

;5: Same thing again. Noticing small white and black dots appearing
;in flat_image. dark_image still has the horizontal lines, some more
;visible than others. 

;I'm guessing that the pattern in flat_image shows the

for i = 0,5 do begin
window,5+i
plot_image,image,title=index[i].wave
print,'Contrast in percent:  '       + strtrim(stddev(image)/mean(image)*100,2)
endfor


;In the unaltered picture (red cont 6684) we can see the distortion
;from what we assume is dark current, and the difference in brightness
;between the two halves. Both of these errors are fixed in the altered
;image, and the overall brightness has been lowered. However the line
;between the two halves is still visible.

;When listing contrast in percent for the altered images we get 11.2689 for
;every image
